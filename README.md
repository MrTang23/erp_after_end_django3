# Illustrate
Due to financial issues and the leader's lack of understanding and support of the author, the project has announced the cessation of development. 
The short development cycle makes it extremely difficult to maintain the project in the later stages, but leaders without technical background may not be aware of this. They will only urge to accelerate the development progress to get the features online as soon as possible.

The process module for data statistics has been removed and the project has been made open source.
Due to the short development cycle (less than two weeks) and 
the fact that the entire software is developed by the author alone on a full stack, 
it is necessary to confirm requirements, design pages, design data structures, etc. 
Therefore, the code is written very roughly and inexperienced. Please understand.  

Thousands of miles of horses are common, but Bole is not. I hope all developers can write code for their ideals.

Finally, I wish all programmer families happiness, promotion and salary increase, and lush hair!
